<h4>MAIDEN'S TOWER</h4>
<p class="places">
    The Maiden's Tower is a structure built on a small islet near Salacak, close to the entrance of the Istanbul Strait
    into the Sea of Marmara. It is a building surrounded by various legends and myths, and it has become a symbol of
    Üsküdar, the district it belongs to, being the only surviving monument from the Byzantine era.
    Originally serving as a burial place during the Greek period, this island was used as a customs station with an
    additional building constructed during the Byzantine period. In the Ottoman era, it served various functions,
    ranging from a show platform to a defense fortress, from an exile station to a quarantine room. Its primary
    function, guiding people with its presence and signaling passing ships with its beacon at night, has remained
    unchanged for centuries. Above all, the Maiden's Tower guides dreams from the past to the future. In the year 2000,
    the Maiden's Tower was restored and transformed into a venue where the sounds of cutlery and chatter can be heard.
    Access to the Maiden's Tower is provided by boats from Salacak and Ortaköy.
    With its ancient history, the Maiden's Tower was once used to collect taxes from ships passing through the strait. A
    large chain was drawn along the European coast from the tower, and ships were allowed to pass between the Asian
    coast and the Maiden's Tower (as the size of ships was small back then). After a while, the tower could not bear the
    weight of the chain and collapsed towards the European side. The ruins of the tower can still be seen underwater
    when looked at from the tower's base.
    Known as Arkla (small castle) and Damialis (calf) in ancient times, the tower once gained fame as the "Tour de
    Leandros" (Leandros' tower). Now, it is associated with the name Maiden's Tower and is referred to by this name.

<h4>GALATA TOWER</h4>
<p class="places">Galata Tower is an important historical structure located in the Galata district of Istanbul. It was
    initially built
    as "Christea Turris" by the Genoese in 1348. The tower was constructed for the defense of Galata, a Genoese colony.
    During that time, Istanbul was under the control of the Byzantine Empire, and Galata served as a Genoese trading
    center.
    The stones used in the construction of the tower were gathered from the ruins of ancient Byzantine structures. The
    tower has a rectangular plan and stands at a height of 66.90 meters. Considering the technology available at the
    time of its construction, it is an impressive edifice.
    Throughout history, Galata Tower has undergone several repairs, restorations, and changes in function. Besides being
    used for defense purposes, it has served as a lookout tower for fires, a lighthouse, an astronomy observation point,
    and even a prison.
    Today, Galata Tower is considered one of the symbols of Istanbul and attracts the attention of tourists who want to
    see the panoramic view of the city. It houses a café and observation terrace, offering visitors a magnificent vista.
